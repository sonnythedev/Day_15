# Day 15

* We reviewed Insertion Sort
* We covered Quick Sort. We ran performance tests against JS Internal Sort
* We started with OOP concepts. How we can create class through function and extend another class.
* In ES6 we have option to use class, extends, static, etc.(Very similar to server side OOP style).
